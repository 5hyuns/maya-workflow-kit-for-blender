"""Undo steps the kit adds right after one of Blender's, taken back and brought back together with it.

Some kit work can only run after Blender has pushed the undo step of the user's action: Auto Key keys a transform
once it ended, the Maya joint pick finishes a box selection after Blender's box select. The kit's step then comes
right after Blender's, and one Ctrl+Z would take back only the kit's part (the key, the joint pick) — the user
presses again and again. Maya makes such a command one undo chunk.

``push`` pushes the kit's step paired with the step before it: it writes a new id into
``Scene.allset_undo_pair_step`` first, so every step remembers the newest paired step at its time. When an Undo
leaves a paired step and lands on the step before it, the kit takes one more Undo (from a timer: the undo system is
busy in its own handlers); when a Redo lands on that step on its way back to the paired step, one more Redo. A
``check`` callable tells whether the landed state really is the user's action (Auto Key: the scene holds the keyed
values); without one the pair is always taken together.

Object-mode steps inside an edit-mode command (``push_through``): an edit-mode command that also changes object data
(Soften Edge giving way to a Smooth by Angle modifier) makes that change in object mode, because an edit-mode undo
step holds only the mesh. It pushes the object-mode state before it (``BEFORE``), the same state back in edit mode,
and the object-mode result (``AFTER``, the command's own step), then goes back to edit mode. Ctrl+Z right after it
lands on the edit-mode state before it (Blender reads the ``BEFORE`` step's data on the way). Each object-mode step
carries its kind in ``Scene.allset_undo_through`` (only in that step's saved data: the value in memory goes back to 0
right after the push and after every undo / redo). An undo / redo that lands on an ``AFTER`` step goes back to edit
mode (the result, as the command left it); one that lands on a ``BEFORE`` step goes on in the same direction (Ctrl+Z
to the step before the command, Shift+Z to its result). Next to a ``BEFORE`` step the edit-mode copy of the state
before the command and the step before the command look alike: when the press started in edit mode it goes past
that one too, so no press seems to do nothing.

Blender reads the newest object-mode step back from memory, not from its data (only a later object-mode step tells
what changed after it), so its kind is lost there: until the next object-mode state (``arm``), an undo from edit mode
that lands in object mode on the command's result is taken as its ``AFTER`` step.
