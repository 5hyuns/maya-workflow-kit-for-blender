"""Maya camera Fit Resolution Gate (#345): how the render frame sits on the camera's film back.

Maya draws two gates in a view that looks through a camera: the film gate is the film back (Horizontal x Vertical
Film Aperture), the resolution gate is the render frame (the render's width : height) and is what renders. Fit
Resolution Gate places the resolution gate on the film gate: Fill fits it inside the film gate (as wide as the film
gate when the render is wider than the film back, else as tall), Horizontal makes it as wide, Vertical as tall, and
Overscan fits the film gate inside it. Maya cameras have a 36 x 24 mm film back; a camera made with Create > Cameras
starts with Fill, the persp / top / front / side cameras of a new scene and the ``camera`` command start with
Horizontal.

Blender renders the camera frame by Sensor Fit: Horizontal / Vertical match the frame's width / height to Sensor
Width / Height; Auto matches the frame's longer side to Sensor Width and doesn't use Sensor Height (the sensor frame a
camera view draws is then a square). ``Camera.allset_film_fit`` keeps Maya's choice and sets Blender's Sensor Fit to
Horizontal or Vertical from it, so Blender's camera frame (the render) is Maya's resolution gate and Blender's sensor
frame (the kit's Film Gate) is Maya's film gate. Fill and Overscan depend on the render's shape: the kit sets Sensor
Fit again when the render size, pixel aspect, film back or the window's scene changes (msgbus), after a file load,
undo and redo, and before a kit render. A Sensor Fit changed in Blender's own camera properties wins: the camera then
shows that fit (Auto, Horizontal or Vertical). Cameras the kit doesn't make keep their Sensor Fit until a fit is
picked for them.
