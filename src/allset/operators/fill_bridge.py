"""Mesh > Fill Hole and Edit Mesh > Bridge with Maya's selection rules (#337).

Fill Hole closes every hole whose border edges are selected with one n-gon, whatever the number of edges around it;
with no edge selected (or the object selected) every hole of the mesh is closed. Bridge (``allset.bridge``,
operators/poly_attribute_nodes.py) joins two sets of border edges (or faces) as a polyBridgeEdge node; a selection
that is exactly one closed loop of border edges is filled with a single face instead, without divisions, like
Maya's Bridge (``fill_single_loops``). Every caller (menus, marking menus, shelf, Modeling Toolkit, option window)
runs these two operators.
