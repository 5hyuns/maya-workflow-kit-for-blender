"""Maya DAG rules for a parent: what happens to a node's descendants.

Maya: a node is drawn only while it **and every ancestor** are visible —
hiding group1 (h, Ctrl+H, its Visibility channel, its display layer's V) hides pCube1 without touching pCube1's own
Visibility, and showing group1 again leaves a child that was hidden on its own hidden. Delete, Export Selection and
Isolate Select take the selected nodes with everything below them.

Blender: a parent's ``hide_viewport`` / ``hide_set`` never hides its children and
``object.delete`` leaves the children, unparented. So:

- ``sync``: an object whose ancestor is hidden (own Visibility = ``hide_viewport``, or its display layer's V; for an
  object under a joint also the joint's display layer, ``ui/layer_joints.py``) gets the view-layer flag
  (``hide_set``) marked ``MARK``; its own ``hide_viewport`` (Maya's Visibility channel) stays as it was. Objects the
  kit did not hide that way are never touched (a layer's or Blender's own ``hide_set`` stays). A display layer's
  Template / Reference reaches every object below a member the same way (Maya: isTemplated / the drawing override
  are inherited): such objects are marked ``layer_editor.INHERITED`` and drawn / locked like a member, the one
  nearest the root winning.
  Run right after kit visibility edits, and from a depsgraph handler (only writes on change, so it settles). The
  handler walks the scene again only when an update can change what it reads (``_what_changed``): a click that
  selects or changes modes leaves it at a look at the update's few entries.
- ``hierarchy``: the selection with all descendants, for Delete (``allset.delete``), Export Selection
  (``selected_hierarchy``) and Isolate Select (``allset.isolate``).
