"""Maya's wireframe on selected objects over shading (lead light green, other selected white).

Maya draws every edge of a selected object in the selection colour over its shading;
Blender only outlines it.

The kit draws the edges itself (POST_VIEW):
- Blender's own ``Object.show_wire`` mixes a selected object's colour with the theme's dormant wire colour
  by up to ~19 % depending on how the edge faces the view (#37cf95 = 0.81 lead + 0.19 #000460),
  so it can't give Maya's flat colour; it is also ID data (saved, in undo steps) and shared with the
  smooth preview 2 cage wire (operators/display.py ``_WIRE_FLAG``).
- Here: evaluated mesh edges in a cached batch per object (numpy, ~28 ms for 100k polys, rebuilt only when
  the object's geometry changes), drawn with the object matrix and a small depth bias (no z-fighting).
  Nothing is written to the file.
- The colours are kit-fixed: the user's theme ``object_active`` / ``object_selected`` is Blender's
  orange, since the kit ships no theme.
  LEAD / OTHER = Maya's lead / other selected colours.
- #76: in wireframe shading Maya draws unselected objects in a dark blue dormant
  wire colour (DORMANT); Blender draws them in the
  theme's wire colour (#181818 here). The same pass draws them in DORMANT (the "Selection Wireframe"
  preference covers both).
- #91: a frame change (playback, scrubbing, ``frame_set``) evaluates the depsgraph without a
  ``depsgraph_update_post``, so a skinned / nCloth mesh kept the wire of the first evaluated frame. ``frame_change_post``
  drops the batches of objects whose evaluated shape can depend on time (``time_dependent``: modifiers, shape keys,
  animated data); static meshes keep their batch.
- A selected lattice is drawn too (Blender's own is the theme's orange). Maya draws a selected
  lattice in the same colours as meshes (white, the lead green). Edges = the lattice grid along U / V / W through the evaluated points
  (``co_deform``).
- Maya highlights the whole hierarchy under a selected object: every descendant shape is drawn in the
  colour of its nearest selected ancestor (Maya: group1
  (selected) -> pCube1 white, pCube2 (lead) -> pCube3 green). Without it a child in front of its selected parent hid
  the parent's wire (side view, pCube2 under pCube1 in front of it) — ``highlighted``.
- #330: Rendered shading draws the wire too. Maya highlights a selection in a lit, shadowed view as well,
  and the Maya layout keeps Blender's outline off, so a selection in Rendered shading (EEVEE, Cycles) had no
  highlight at all. The depth test works there: EEVEE writes the view's depth, and for an external engine
  Blender draws a depth pass of the objects while overlays are on. The one rule (``view_draws``) is Blender's
  own for its outline: overlays on. The IPR window's picture turns its overlays off, so it stays clean.
