"""Joints in Maya display layers.

Maya: a joint picked in a view is a node of its own, so a display layer made from a picked joint holds that joint
only (one node, one layer: adding it to another layer moves it). The layer's state reaches everything below a member:
a hidden layer hides the member joint, every joint below it and the objects under them; Template draws them grey,
Reference black, and neither can be picked. The bone from the member's parent joint stays (a bone belongs to its
parent joint). A parent's Template or Reference wins over a child's Normal layer, and a hidden parent hides a child
whose own layer is visible. Skinned surfaces are not members and keep deforming. A joint's own Visibility works the
same way: off, it hides every joint and object below it, whose own Visibility stays as it was.

Here a joint's layer is ``PoseBone.allset_display_layer`` (the layer collection: a renamed joint or layer keeps it, a
duplicated skeleton copies it, undo takes it back, a deleted layer leaves None). A layer never writes the joint's own
flags (``PoseBone.hide`` is its Visibility channel): ``state(ob)`` = {joint name: HIDDEN / TEMPLATE / REFERENCE} of
every joint a layer reaches and every joint below a joint whose Visibility is off (a bone the panel Show > NURBS
Curves filter hid is no Visibility), kept per skeleton until a layer, a membership, a Visibility, the skeleton,
playback or undo changes it.
The kit's joint drawing, joint picking, Outliner rows and parent rule (``operators/dag.py``) read it; Blender's own
bone drawing (a view with the Bones overlay on) and Blender's bone operators don't know it.
